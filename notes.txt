Listen for a POSTed file.  Can only be JSON.

1. Read data, return results in JSON
path: /read_device
IN: {"MAC":["xxyyzz","xxyyaa",..],"return_addr":"http://ha:1234/receive"}
Actually, no.  Do one at a time, since the http request needs to be synchronous.
IN: {"MAC":"xxyyzz"}

OUT:
       {
           "MAC":"aabbccdd",
           "result":true, # true = good false = failed    
           "locked":true,
           "Temperature":27,
           "foo","bar"
       }



2. Set:
    - Temperature
    - Lock
    - Boost
    - 
Path: /set_device

3. Scan
Do we really need scan?  Just maintain a list of the trvs.  It's not long
and it doesn't change often.

/scan
IN: POST {"scan":true,"return_addr":"http://192.168.42.1:8043"}


OUT:
 {"devices_found":['aabbcc','aabbdd','aabbee']}
